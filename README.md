# Capacitive Keyboard

The capacitive keyboard shows how to use capacitive sensing to handle six values at a time. Includes two outputs: in the first, tapping the keys triggers a bubbling display on an LED Matrix panel; in the second, Arduino sends the values to a Processing sketch that displays them in a circular graph form.
