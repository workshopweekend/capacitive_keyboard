# Capacitive Keyboard

The capacitive keyboard shows how to use capacitive sensing to handle six values at a time. Tapping the keys sends data to a Processing sketch that shows how much you're pressing on the kays and plays "notes" based on your taps.

Requires minimal wiring skill; moderately complex programming.
