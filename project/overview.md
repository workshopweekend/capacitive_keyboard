# Capacitive Keyboard

The capacitive keyboard shows how to use capacitive sensing to handle six values at a time. Includes two outputs: in the first, tapping the keys triggers a bubbling display on an LED Matrix panel (like [this one from Adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com/products/555)); in the second, Arduino sends the values to a Processing sketch that displays them in a circular graph form.

Requires minimal soldering skill; moderately complex programming.
