1.  Change the threshold value to make the keyboard more or less sensitive.

2.  Add extra keys to the keyboard, and extra notes to the code.

3.  **Challenge:** Modify the code so that the notes are louder or last longer the harder you press. (This challenge requires some advanced programming skill!)
