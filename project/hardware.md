You'll need the following components:

- **Optional:** 18&times;24 LED Matrix, like [this one from Adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com/products/555). Should include ribbon cable.
- 6&times; 1 M&Omega; resistors.
- 6 paperclips and optionally copper foil to make a more solid terminal.
- 20 or so wires.
- Solderless breadboard.
 
Preparing the LED Matrix board may also require a soldering iron to bridge jumper J5 on the back of the board. [See the Adafruit tutorial for details](http://learn.adafruit.com/16x24-led-matrix/wiring).
